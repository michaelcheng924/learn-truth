      1. Whosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold
      the catholic faith;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      2. Which faith except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt
      he shall perish everlastingly.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      3. And the catholic faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and
      Trinity in Unity;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>4. Neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      5. For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another
      of the Holy Spirit.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      6. But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit is
      all one, the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      7. Such as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      8. The Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      9. The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, and the Holy
      Spirit incomprehensible.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      10. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>11. And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      12. As also there are not three uncreated nor three incomprehensible, but
      one uncreated and one incomprehensible.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      13. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy
      Spirit almighty.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>14. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      15. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>16. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      17. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit
      Lord;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>18. And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge
      every Person by himself to be God and Lord;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      20. So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three
      Gods or three Lords.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>21. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      22. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor
      created, nor begotten, but proceeding.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      24. So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons;
      one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      25. And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or
      less than another.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>26. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      27. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the
      Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      28. He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      29. Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also
      believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      30. For the right faith is that we believe and confess that our Lord Jesus
      Christ, the Son of God, is God and man.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      31. God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and
      man of substance of His mother, born in the world.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      32. Perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh
      subsisting.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      33. Equal to the Father as touching His Godhead, and inferior to the
      Father as touching His manhood.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      34. Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      35. One, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking of
      that manhood into God.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      36. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      37. For as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and man is one
      Christ;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      38. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the
      third day from the dead;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      39. He ascended into heaven, He sits on the right hand of the Father, God,
      Almighty;
    </Txt>

    <Txt>40. From thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.</Txt>

    <Txt>41. At whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies;</Txt>

    <Txt>42. and shall give account of their own works.</Txt>

    <Txt>
      43. And they that have done good shall go into life everlasting and they
      that have done evil into everlasting fire.
    </Txt>

    <Txt>
      44. This is the catholic faith, which except a man believe faithfully he
      cannot be saved.
