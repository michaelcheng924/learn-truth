      <B>THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION</B>

      Agreed upon by the Archbishops, Bishops, and the whole clergy of the
      Provinces of Canterbury and York, London, 1562.

      <B>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or
      passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and
      Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this
      Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the
      Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
      Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father,
      took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so
      that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and
      Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof
      is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, war crucified,
      dead and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not
      only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>III. Of the going down of Christ into Hell</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that
      he went down into Hell.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with
      flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's
      nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he
      return to judge all Men at the last day.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>V. Of the Holy Ghost</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one
      substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and
      eternal God.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for salvation</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
      whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
      required of any man, that it should be. believed as an article of the
      Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of
      the Holy Scripture we do understand those Canonical Books of the Old and
      New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.

    <Txt>
      <B>VII. Of the Old Testament</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New
      Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the
      only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they
      are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for
      transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching
      Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts
      thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet
      notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of
      the Commandments which are called Moral.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>VIII. Of the Three Creeds</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is
      commonly called the Apostles' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and
      believed: for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy
      Scripture.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>IX. Of Original or Birth-sin</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Original Sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
      vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the mature of every
      man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is
      very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature
      inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit;
      and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's
      wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature Both remain, yea in them
      that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in the Greek,
      phronema sarkos, which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some
      the affection some the desire, of the flesh, is not subject to the Law of
      God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are
      baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath
      of itself the nature of sin.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>X. Of Free Will</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn
      and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith,
      and calling upon God: Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant
      and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us,
      that we may have a ,good will, and working with us, when we have that good
      will.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XI. Of the justification of Adam</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and
      Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings:
      Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only is a most wholesome
      Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the
      Homily of Justification.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XII. Of Good Works</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
      Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's
      judgement; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do
      spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a
      lively, Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XIII. Of Works before Justification</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit,
      are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus
      Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the
      School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they
      are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt
      not but they have the nature of sin.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XIV. Of Works of Supererogation</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they
      call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogant' and
      impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God
      as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than
      of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have
      done all that arc commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XV. Of Christ alone without Sin</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin
      only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his
      spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself
      once made, should take away the sins of the world, and sin, as Saint ,John
      saith, was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born
      again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin,
      we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XVI. Of Sin after Baptism</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the
      Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to
      be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received
      the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by
      the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore
      they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they
      live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XVII. Of Predestination and Election</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before
      the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his
      counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he
      hath chosen in Christ out of mankind. and to bring them by Christ to
      everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be
      endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God's
      purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the
      calling: they be justified freely: then be made sons of God by adoption:
      they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son ,Jesus Christ: they
      walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain
      to everlasting felicity.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ,
      is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and
      such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying
      the works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their
      mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly
      establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed
      through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards
      God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to
      have continually before their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination,
      is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either
      into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less
      perilous than desperation.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be
      generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will
      of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the
      Word of God.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall
      be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to
      frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy
      Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men
      must be saved.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XIX. Of the Church</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the
      which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be
      dulyministered according to Christ's ordinance in all those things that of
      necessity are requisite to the same.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also
      the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of
      Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XX. Of the Authority of the Church</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authorityin
      Controversies of Faith: And yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain
      any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so
      expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.
      Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, as
      it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same
      ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of
      Salvation.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXI. Of the Authority of General Councils</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      General Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and
      will of Princes. And when they be gathered together, (forasmuch as they be
      an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and Word
      of God,) they may err, and sometimes have erred, even in things pertaining
      unto God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have
      neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be
      taken out of Holy Scripture.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXII. Of Purgatory</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and
      Adoration, as well of Images as of Reliques, and also invocation of
      Saints, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of
      Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of publick
      preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be
      lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge
      lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men
      who have publick authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call
      and send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>
        XXIV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people
        understandeth
      </B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the
      Primitive Church, to have publick Prayer in the Church, or to minister the
      Sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXV. Of the Sacraments</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian
      men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual
      signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which he doth work
      invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and
      confirm our Faith in him.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that
      is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,
      Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and extreme Unction, are not to be counted for
      Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt
      following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the
      Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and
      the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony
      ordained of God.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be
      carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as
      worthily receive the same they have a wholesome effect or operation: but
      they that receive them unworthily purchase to themselves damnation, as
      Saint Paul saith.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>
        XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect
        of the Sacrament
      </B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and
      sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word
      and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name,
      but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may
      use their ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving of
      the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by
      their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by
      faith and rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be
      effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they be
      ministered by evil then.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that
      inquire be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that
      have knowledge of their offences; and finally being found guilty, by just
      judgement be deposed.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXVII. Of Baptism</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
      Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is
      also a sign of Regeneration or new Birth, whereby, as by an instrument,
      they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the
      promises of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be sons of God by
      the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and
      Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The Baptism of young
      Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church, as most agreeable
      with the institution of Christ.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXVIII. Of the Lord's Supper</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians
      ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather is a Sacrament
      of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as rightly,
      worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a
      partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a
      partaking of the Blood of Christ.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in
      the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to
      the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and
      hath given occasion to many superstitions.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      The Body of Christ is given, taken and eaten in the Supper, only after an
      heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is
      received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved,
      carried about, lifted up or worshipped.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>
        XXIX. Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the
        Lord's Supper
      </B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Wicked. and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do
      carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the
      Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they
      partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do cat and drink
      the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXX. Of both kinds</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the
      parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,
      ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXI. Of the Oblation of Christ of Christ finished upon the Cross</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation,
      and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and
      actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone.
      Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said,
      that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have
      remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous
      deceits.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      Bishops, Priests and Deacons are not commanded by God's Law, either to vow
      the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is
      lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to mary at their own
      discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      That person whcih by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off
      from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the
      whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be
      openly reconciled by penance and received into the Church by a Judge that
      hath authority thereunto.

      <B>XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one,
      and utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be
      changed according to the diversities of countries, times, and men's
      manners, so that nothing be ordained against God's Word. Whosoever through
      his private judgement, willingly and purposely, cloth openly break the
      traditions and ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the
      Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be
      rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that
      offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the
      authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak
      brethren.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and
      abolish, ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man's
      authority, so that all things be done to edifying.

      <B>XXXV. Of the Homilies</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined
      under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and
      necessary for these tunes, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were
      set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to
      be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they
      may be understanded of the people.

      <B>XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Book of Consecration of :archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of
      Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the tine of Edward the Sixth, and
      confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, Both contain all
      things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither bath it any
      thing, that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore
      whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book,
      since the second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or
      hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we
      decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and
      ordered.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The King's Majesty bath the chief power in this Realm of England, and
      other his Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this
      Realm, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes cloth
      appertain, and is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign
      jurisdiction.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      Where we attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government, by which
      Titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we
      give not to our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the
      Sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by
      Elizabeth our Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative,
      which we see to have been given always to all godly Princes in Holy
      Scriptures by God himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and
      degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical
      or Temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evildoers.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.</Txt>
    <Txt>
      The Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death, for heinous and
      grievous offences.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to
      wear weapons, and serve in the wars.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXVIII. Of Christian men's Goods, which are not common</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right,
      title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely
      boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,
      liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
    </Txt>
    <Txt>
      <B>XXXIX. Of a Christian man's oath</B>
    </Txt>
    <Txt first>
      As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by
      our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian
      Religion cloth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate
      requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the
      Prophet's teaching, injustice, judgement, and truth.
