    <div>
      10. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.

    <div>11. And yet they are not three eternals but one eternal.</div>
    <br />

    <div>

      one uncreated and one incomprehensible.

    <div>
      13. So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy
      Spirit almighty.

    <br />

    <div>14. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty.</div>
    <br />

    <div>
      15. So the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God;

    <br />

    <div>16. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God.</div>
    <br />

      17. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit
      Lord;

    <br />

    <div>18. And yet they are not three Lords but one Lord.</div>
    <br />

    <div>
      19. For like as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge
      every Person by himself to be God and Lord;
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      20. So are we forbidden by the catholic religion to say; There are three
      Gods or three Lords.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>21. The Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten.</div>
    <br />

      22. The Son is of the Father alone; not made nor created, but begotten.
    </div>

      23. The Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son; neither made, nor
      created, nor begotten, but proceeding.

      one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>
      25. And in this Trinity none is afore or after another; none is greater or
      less than another.
    </div>
    <br />

    <div>26. But the whole three persons are coeternal, and coequal.</div>

      believe rightly the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.

      31. God of the substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and

      34. Who, although He is God and man, yet He is not two, but one Christ.

      that manhood into God.

      36. One altogether, not by confusion of substance, but by unity of person.

      Christ;

    <div>
      38. Who suffered for our salvation, descended into hell, rose again the
      third day from the dead;

      <strong>I. Of Faith in the Holy Trinity.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or
      passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and
      Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this
      Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the
      Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>II. Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the
      Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father,
      took Man's nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so
      that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and
      Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof
      is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified,
      dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice,
      not only for original guilt, but also for actual sins of men
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>III. Of the going down of Christ into Hell.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      As Christ died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed, that
      he went down into Hell.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with
      flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man's
      nature; wherewith he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he
      return to judge all Men at the last day.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>V. Of the Holy Ghost.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one
      substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and
      eternal God.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that
      whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be
      required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the
      Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of
      the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old and
      New Testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>Of the Names and Number of the Canonical Books.</div>
    <div>Genesis, The First Book of Samuel, The Book of Esther,</div>
    <div>Exodus, The Second Book of Samuel, The Book of Job,</div>
    <div>Leviticus, The First Book of Kings, The Psalms,</div>
    <div>Numbers, The Second Book of Kings, The Proverbs,</div>
    <div>
      Deuteronomy, The First Book of Chronicles, Ecclesiastes or Preacher,
    </div>
    <div>
      Joshua, The Second Book of Chronicles, Cantica, or Songs of Solomon,
    </div>
    <div>Judges, The First Book of Esdras, Four Prophets the greater,</div>
    <div>Ruth, The Second Book of Esdras, Twelve Prophets the less.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of
      life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to
      establish any doctrine; such are these following:
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>The Third Book of Esdras, The rest of the Book of Esther,</div>
    <div>The Fourth Book of Esdras, The Book of Wisdom,</div>
    <div>The Book of Tobias, Jesus the Son of Sirach,</div>
    <div>The Book of Judith, Baruch the Prophet,</div>
    <div>The Song of the Three Children, The Prayer of Manasses,</div>
    <div>The Story of Susanna, The First Book of Maccabees,</div>
    <div>Of Bel and the Dragon, The Second Book of Maccabees.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      All the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do
      receive, and account them Canonical.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>VII. Of the Old Testament.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New
      Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the
      only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they
      are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for
      transitory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching
      Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts
      thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet
      notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of
      the Commandments which are called Moral.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>VIII. Of the Creeds.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles' Creed,
      ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by
      most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The original Article given Royal assent in 1571 and reaffirmed in 1662,
      was entitled "Of the Three Creeds; and began as follows, "The Three
      Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius's Creed, and that which is commonly
      called the Apostles' Creed ..."
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>IX. Of Original or Birth-Sin.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do
      vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every
      man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is
      very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature
      inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit;
      and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God's
      wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea in them
      that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek,
      φρονημα σαρκος, (which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some
      the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not subject to the Law
      of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and
      are baptized; yet the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust
      hath of itself the nature of sin.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>X. Of Free-Will.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn
      and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith;
      and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant
      and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us,
      that we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good
      will.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XI. Of the Justification of Man.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and
      Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings.
      Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome
      Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the
      Homily of Justification.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XII. Of Good Works.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after
      Justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God's
      judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do
      spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith insomuch that by them a
      lively Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XIII. Of Works before Justification.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of his Spirit,
      are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus
      Christ; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the
      School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they
      are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt
      not but they have the nature of sin.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XIV. Of Works of Supererogation.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God's Commandments, which they
      call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and
      impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God
      as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake, than
      of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly When ye have
      done all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XV. Of Christ alone without Sin.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin
      only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his
      spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself
      once made, should take away the sins of the world; and sin (as Saint John
      saith) was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born
      again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin,
      we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XVI. Of Sin after Baptism.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the
      Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to
      be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received
      the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by
      the grace of God we may arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore
      they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they
      live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XVII. Of Predestination and Election.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before
      the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his
      counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he
      hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to
      everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be
      endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according to God's
      purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the
      calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption:
      they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they
      walk religiously in good works, and at length, by God's mercy, they attain
      to everlasting felicity.
    </div>
    <br />
    As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ, is
    full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such
    as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the
    works of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to
    high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and
    confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ as
    because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and
    carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before
    their eyes the sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous
    downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or
    into wretchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than
    desperation.
    <div>
      Furthermore, we must receive God's promises in such wise, as they be
      generally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will
      of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the
      Word of God.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XVIII. Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall
      be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to
      frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature. For Holy
      Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men
      must be saved.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XIX. Of the Church.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which
      the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered
      according to Christ's ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are
      requisite to the same.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred, so also
      the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of
      Ceremonies, but also in matters of Faith.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XX. Of the Authority of the Church.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in
      Controversies of Faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain
      any thing that is contrary to God's Word written, neither may it so
      expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.
      Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ,
      yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the
      same ought it not to enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of
      Salvation.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXI. Of the Authority of General Councils.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      [The Twenty-first of the former Articles is omitted; because it is partly
      of a local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the remaining
      parts of it, in other Articles.]
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article, omitted in the version of
      1801, reads as follows: "General Councils may not be gathered together
      without the commandment and will of Princes. And when they be gathered
      together, (forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not
      governed with the Spirit and Word of God,) they may err, and sometimes
      have erred, even in things pertaining unto God. Wherefore things ordained
      by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority,
      unless it may be declared that they be taken out of holy Scripture."
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXII. Of Purgatory.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and
      Adoration, as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of Saints,
      is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of
      Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public
      preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be
      lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge
      lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men
      who have public authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and
      send Ministers into the Lord's vineyard.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XXIV. Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people
        understandeth.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the
      Primitive Church to have public Prayer in the Church, or to minister the
      Sacraments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXV. Of the Sacraments.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian
      men's profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual
      signs of grace, and God's good will towards us, by the which he doth work
      invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and
      confirm our Faith in him.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that
      is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation,
      Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for
      Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt
      following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the
      Scriptures, but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and
      the Lord's Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony
      ordained of God.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be
      carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as
      worthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation: but
      they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as
      Saint Paul saith.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect
        of the Sacraments.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and
      sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word
      and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name,
      but in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may
      use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving the
      Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by
      their wickedness, nor the grace of God's gifts diminished from such as by
      faith, and rightly, do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which
      be effectual, because of Christ's institution and promise, although they
      be ministered by evil men.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that
      inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that
      have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty, by just
      judgment be deposed.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXVII. Of Baptism.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
      Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is
      also a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth, whereby, as by an instrument,
      they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the
      promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of
      God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed, Faith is confirmed,
      and Grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church,
      as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXVIII. Of the Lord's Supper.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians
      ought to have among themselves one to another, but rather it is a
      Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ's death: insomuch that to such as
      rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we
      break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of
      Blessing is a partaking of the Blood of Christ.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in
      the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to
      the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and
      hath given occasion to many superstitions.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after
      an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ
      is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was not by Christ's ordinance reserved,
      carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XXIX. Of the Wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the
        Lord's Supper.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do
      carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the
      Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they
      partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink
      the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXX. Of both Kinds.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the
      parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Christ's ordinance and commandment,
      ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XXXI. Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect redemption, propitiation,
      and satisfaction, for all the sins of the whole world, both original and
      actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone.
      Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said,
      that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have
      remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous
      deceits.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God's Law, either to
      vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it
      is lawful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own
      discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>
        XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided.
      </strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off
      from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the
      whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be
      openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that
      hath authority thereunto.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one,
      or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be
      changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men's manners,
      so that nothing be ordained against God's Word. Whosoever, through his
      private judgment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the
      Traditions and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the
      Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be
      rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that
      offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the
      authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth the consciences of the weak
      brethren.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and
      abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the Church ordained only by man's
      authority, so that all things be done to edifying.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXXV. Of the Homilies.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined
      under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and
      necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which were
      set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and therefore we judge them to
      be read in Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they
      may he understanded of the people.

      [This Article is received in this Church, so far as it declares the Books
      of Homilies to be an explication of Christian doctrine, and instructive in
      piety and morals. But all references to the constitution and laws of
      England are considered as inapplicable to the circumstances of this
      Church; which also suspends the order for the reading of said Homilies in
      churches, until a revision of them may be conveniently made, for the
      clearing of them, as well from obsolete words and phrases, as from the
      local references.]

      <strong>XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Book of Consecration of Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and Deacons,
      as set forth by the General Convention of this Church in 1792, doth
      contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering; neither
      hath it any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and ungodly. And,
      therefore, whosoever are consecrated or ordered according to said Form, we
      decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and
      ordered.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article reads as follows: "The Book
      of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and
      Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth, and confirmed
      at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things
      necessary to such Consecration and Ordering: neither hath it any thing,
      that of itself is superstitious and ungodly. And therefore whosoever are
      consecrated or ordered according to the Rites of that Book, since the
      second year of the forenamed King Edward unto this time, or hereafter
      shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same Rites; we decree all
      such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered."

      <strong>XXXVII. Of the Power of the Civil Magistrates.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Power of the Civil Magistrate extendeth to all men, as well Clergy as
      Laity, in all things temporal; but hath no authority in things purely
      spiritual. And we hold it to be the duty of all men who are professors of
      the Gospel, to pay respectful obedience to the Civil Authority, regularly
      and legitimately constituted.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      The original 1571, 1662 text of this Article reads as follows: "The King's
      Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of England, and other his
      Dominions, unto whom the chief Government of all Estates of this Realm,
      whether they be Ecclesiastical or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and
      is not, nor ought to be, subject to any foreign Jurisdiction. Where we
      attribute to the King's Majesty the chief government, by which Titles we
      understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended; we give not
      our Princes the ministering either of God's Word, or of the Sacraments,
      the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our
      Queen do most plainly testify; but that only prerogative, which we see to
      have been given always to all godly Princes in holy Scriptures by God
      himself; that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed
      to their charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Temporal, and
      restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this Realm of England.</div>
    <br />

      grievous offences.

    <div>
      <strong>XXXVIII. Of Christian Men's Goods, which are not common.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      The Riches and Goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right,
      title, and possession of the same; as certain Anabaptists do falsely
      boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,
      liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      <strong>XXXIX. Of a Christian Man's Oath.</strong>
    </div>
    <div>
      As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden Christian men by
      our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle, so we judge, that Christian
      Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate
      requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the
      Prophet's teaching in justice, judgment, and truth.
