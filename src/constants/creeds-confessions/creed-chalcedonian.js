      We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach men to
      confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in
      Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a
      reasonable [rational] soul and body; consubstantial [co-essential] with
      the Father according to the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according
      to the Manhood; in all things like unto us, without sin; begotten before
      all ages of the Father according to the Godhead, and in these latter days,
      for us and for our salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God,
      according to the Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only
      begotten, to be acknowledged in two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably,
      indivisibly, inseparably; the distinction of natures being by no means
      taken away by the unity, but rather the property of each nature being
      preserved, and concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or
      divided into two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God
      the Word, the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the beginning [have
      declared] concerning him, and the Lord Jesus Christ himself has taught us,
      and the Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.
